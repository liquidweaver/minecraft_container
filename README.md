minecraft_container
===================

Minecraft, forge, and ComputerCraft - as a container.

ComputerCraft - http://www.computercraft.info
  - Note that the version supported likely lags Minecraft quite a bit.

MinecraftForge - http://files.minecraftforge.net
  - Follow the bit.ly links, and you'll see an obvious url you can copy from the bit.ly one to put in the Dockerfile.
